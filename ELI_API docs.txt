# ELI Gateway API Documentation

## Overview
Ericsson Language Intelligence (ELI) is a platform that offers a suite of assets [models, datasets, code, services, and APIs] that allows projects at Ericsson to self-serve Telecom-specific Generative AI/LLM capabilities and accelerate the delivery of their AI needs.

## Authentication
HTTP Bearer authentication is required. Send `Authorization` in the header containing the word `Bearer` followed by a space and a Token String.

## API Endpoints

### Intelligent Search

#### GET /api/v1/rag/search_filters/{index_name}
Fetch search filters in the specific index of the vector store

This endpoint returns a dictionary representing the search filters in a specific index.
The response contains the following information: categories, library-id, and library-title.
Additionally, it includes the status of the search filters if there's a refresh in progress.

##### Parameters:
`user_id`: The end user ID to be set by system clients.
`customer_profile_id`: The customer profile ID to be set by system clients.

##### Response:
The structure of `search_filters` field in the response is:
```
{
    "category-1": {
        "library-id1": "library-title-1",
        "library-id2": "library-title-2",
    },
    "category-2": {
        "library-id3": "library-title-3",
        "library-id4": "library-title-4",
    }
}
```

Use asterisk (*) to query the default index.

#### GET /api/v1/llm/list
Lists available LLM models in the ELI platform.

### LLM Services

The API includes endpoints for interacting with language models:
- Chat completion endpoints
- Model information and capabilities
- Parameter configurations for model calls

### Embedding Services

The API provides text embedding capabilities:

#### POST /api/v1/embeddings
Generate vector embeddings for text inputs.

##### Request Body:
```json
{
  "model": "eli-embedding-small-1",
  "texts": [
    "string"
  ],
  "max_seq_length": 512,
  "client": "string"
}
```

##### Parameters:
- `model`: The embedding model to use (default: eli-embedding-small-1)
- `texts`: Array of text strings to embed (required)
- `max_seq_length`: Maximum sequence length (default: 512)
- `client`: Client identifier

### RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

The API provides RAG capabilities for:
- Document search with semantic understanding
- Context-aware responses based on retrieved information
- Filtering search results by various parameters

### Common Response Structure

Most API endpoints return responses with this structure:

#### ELIBaseResponse:
- message: string
- status: string (Default: success)
- time_elapsed: string

### Common Parameters
Parameters used across multiple endpoints include:
- user_id: The end user ID
- customer_profile_id: The customer profile ID
- index_name: Name of the vector index to query
- cpi_library_id: One or more Library Identities
- cpi_library_title: One or more Library Titles

### Chat Message Format
For chat-based endpoints, messages follow this structure:
- role: string (user/assistant/system)
- content: string (the actual message content)

## Error Handling
Validation errors are returned with appropriate status codes and detailed error messages.

## Base URL
