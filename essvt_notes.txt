want to automate test cases and try to run it? 
or user that wants to see if test cases are there how to run it

ESSVT
- used for functional testing, sanity checks, any sort of testing
- when we use essvt, we will get admin access 
- project catalog is where we upload projects
    - go in a project, you can see test cases within it (pronect -> project files)
    - .robot files run the files automatically
- go to orders to create an order. to run a test. give order name xyz. robot os serial execution, pabot is paralell execution\
- then go to options, add runtime variables, copu paste from other orders just to test
- test data type suit: you can give a suit list
    suppose i want to test some test cases that is part of that files
    then I need to browse to the proper robot I want to run
    select the suite 
- test data type case: I can run individual test cases instead of 20-25 test cases taht are in that one files
    you can click individual test cases here. 
- when running create new execution for the order, add some options
    auto rerun if fail 
    merge results ??
    re run failed only
    you have to run the execution manually
- when you create a suite, add test cases, options execution
- create order

in the project overview you can see project files, runner (robot runners)
- schedulers
    - in linux system you can set up cron job this is is similar to that
    - set order of execution and time of execution
- executions
- hustory you can see previous executions. Click on the execution you can see overview, report and log
    - download from history the individual execution
    - your downloads will be the same as what is in the drive. 
    - you can see the test execution log as well where the callback chain is 
    - you can cross reference which test cases/suites got executed

you can also create project and add project files and do everything from there
